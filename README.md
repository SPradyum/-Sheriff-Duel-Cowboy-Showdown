# 🤠 Sheriff Duel – Cowboy Showdown  
*A fast-paced Wild West reaction shooter built with Python & Pygame*

Sheriff Duel is a reaction-based arcade game where you face off against an AI outlaw in a Wild West showdown.  
Every round begins with a countdown — **shoot too early and you lose**...  
Wait for the signal: **DRAW!** — and fire faster than the bandit to survive.

The game includes blood hit animations, screen-shake effects, unlockable weapons, desert-style visuals, taunts, and progressive difficulty — making every duel feel cinematic.
